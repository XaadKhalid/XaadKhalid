Hello, I'm Saad Khalid, a recent graduate with a strong passion for software engineering and a focus on both web and app development. During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the world of technology, where I honed my skills in various frameworks and technologies.

On the web development front, I've worked extensively with Bootstrap to create responsive and visually appealing web applications. Simultaneously, I ventured into the realm of mobile app development, utilizing React Native to craft cross-platform mobile solutions that engage users with seamless experiences.

For backend development and data management, I delved into the .NET Framework, enabling me to build robust and efficient server-side components. To support these applications, I employed MySQL for database management, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

As I embark on my career journey as a software engineer, I am excited to continue learning and contributing to innovative projects that challenge me to grow and evolve. This GitHub repository showcases some of my past work and serves as a testament to my dedication to the field of software development.

Feel free to explore my projects, provide feedback, or reach out if you're interested in collaboration. I look forward to connecting with fellow developers and potential employers as I strive to make a meaningful impact in the world of web and app development.
